<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify" > In today's world, many children are given tablets at the age of two.
    Rookie Vision is a free, accessible website that takes images and determines
    what it is! This can be fun to both children as little as 3 to a grown adult!
    Critical thinking and learning to use technology are fundamental skills
    to demanding jobs such as a Data Scientist. <br>
     <br>
    Rookie Vision recognizes facial expressions of humans, and can be used to teach <br>
    common sense and real-life situations.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p> On the day of HackUMassIX, the group was formed. We had no expectations or prior knowledge <br>
    of ideas and projects. After hours of brainstorming between crazy ideas from moving pillows, <br>
    U-card finder, and drones, we finally decided on creating a website using Google's API. <br>
    Special thanks to Simon, who made this webiste more than just a page;; it's an app<br>
</p>

<h3>Techs Used</h3>
<p>Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, Google Cloud</p>

    <p> Seeing others' <a href="https://dashboard.hackumass.com/">Hackathon Projects</a> inspired us to do something we really wanted to do
